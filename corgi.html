        <h2>General</h2>
        <p class="article-text">The Welsh Corgi, sometimes known as a Corgi, is a small type of herding dog that originated in Wales. Two separate breeds are recognized: the Pembroke Welsh Corgi and the Cardigan Welsh Corgi. There are physical differences between the two types. According to the breed standards, overall the Cardigan is larger, both in weight and in height. Traditionally, the tails were of different shapes, but docking had previously been used. The Pembroke Welsh Corgi gained in popularity because the Queen has personally owned more than 30 Pembrokes or Corgi-Dachshund crosses, known as dorgis.</p>
        
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p class="article-text">Welsh Corgis have historically been used as herding dogs, specifically for cattle. They are of the type of herding dog referred to as "heelers", meaning that they would nip at the heels of the larger animals to keep them on the move. Both Pembrokeshire and Cardigan are historically agricultural areas of Wales. The combination of the low height off the ground and innate agility of Welsh Corgis would allow them to avoid the hooves of cattle. The term "Corgi" means either cur dog or dwarf dog in the Welsh language, which was not intended as an insult to the dog's size, rather as a purely descriptive term. There is also a folk legend that says Corgis were a gift from the woodland fairies, and that the breed's markings were left on its coat by fairy harnesses and saddles; however, the origins of this legend are dubious.</p>
        
        <h2>Need to know before owning a corgi</h2>
        <p class="article-text">This is a breed that becomes bored very easily. What this means is that you’re going to spend a great deal of time making sure that this dog has a job; it needs something to do and something to keep it busy so that it’s not bored enough to cause problems. Many people are unaware of this and have to learn the hard way.</p>

        <p class="article-text">This is a dog with a very simple to groom coat, which makes the process very easy on owners. It’s a little something that many potential dog owners want to know before they choose a specific breed. Grooming, after all, takes a lot of time and effort and it’s not something some people want to have to spend a great deal of time working on.</p>
        <p class="article-text">This is a dog that makes a good watchdog, which is another little fact that many people want to know. These dogs are very protective and they are very alert, which makes them good dogs to keep watch out for things and people you don’t see coming.</p>
        <p class="article-text">If you choose a Corgi, you’re going to find out quickly that it does very well with other animals in your home. You just have to make sure that you get this dog acclimated to your other animals as quickly as possible so that they become friends. Otherwise the dog is going to have issues with the other animals. It tends only to like animals it’s familiar with.</p>
        <p class="article-text">If you let this dog go too long without exercise, a walk or people to play with, it’s going to get destructive. It’s going to find something to do, whether that is digging a hole to escape from behind a fence or eating something you don’t want it to eat; like your shoe collection. It needs stimulation at all times, so be prepared to give the dog what it wants and needs.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Your dog is going to become very territorial around other animals if it does not know them. This is why it’s so important to socialize the dog with the animals it will spend a great deal of time with. This is going to prevent some serious issues in that you will not have to worry about the animals fighting or deal with issues that you can’t handle.</p>

        <p class="article-text">If you plan on walking this dog or taking it to the park or letting it out in the yard, keep it on a leash. It likes to chase things, and it will chase them whether you say no or not. This dog loves to chase kids, animals, cars or anything else that moves. This is why a leash is such a good idea; it keeps the cat from becoming too much of a wreck.</p>
        <p class="article-text">While this is a breed that does very well with other animals and kids, it does like to nip at them. This means you will need to be extra careful when your new corgi is around your kids, especially small ones. It’s not trying to hurt them, but this breed does think that this is fun, and that’s going to cause potential harm to your kids if you are not careful.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Remember when we said that this is a breed that is a good watchdog? We were not kidding about that; but we should mention that if you’re considering a corgi, you’ll want to know it’s a barker. It really does like to make a lot of noise, and it’s going to bark at any and everything it possibly can. You’re going to want to be careful of this, watch out for this and make sure that you can handle this kind of issue should it arise.</p>
        <p class="article-text">Even though it has a coat that is easy to groom, this is a dog that does shed a lot. It’s important to know this since many dog owners are more concerned about this fact that most other facts when getting a dog. The corgi is a breed that will leave a lot of hair in a lot of places, but brushing the dog regularly will help to minimize the amount of shedding you will deal with.</p>
        <p class="article-text">The corgi therefore really enjoy a nice neighborhood like the one on the video because it needs to socialize itself with other animals to prevent issues with it being too territorial if you were to have guests over or what not.</p>
